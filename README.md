# TSE Design System

The TSE Design System is a unified set of components aiming to give TSE projects a cohesive look and feel.

It is implemeneted as a [React](https://react.dev) component library written using [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Using in a Project

This section is still a TODO until we publish our first version of the library.

## Development

To develop components for the TSE Design System, first install development dependencies with:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the development server with:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the development site.
